  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSpeedX/PROXY-List/master/socks4.txt
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShiftyTR/Proxy-List/master/socks4.txt
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monosans/proxy-list/main/proxies/socks4.txt

 6) Now use one of the commands below for starting

### Startup Command: 

- For user friendly CLI/auto mode with colors:
```
java -jar XDDOS.jar
```
- For user friendly CLI/auto mode without colors:
```
java -jar XDDOS.jar -noansi

```
java -jar XDDOS.jar [ip] [protocol] [method] [time] [netty threads] [loop threads] [y/n]
